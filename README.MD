# Web Components Example

Examples for using Web Components that ideally work in all the latest versions of browsers.

This example was inspired by the finding a cross browser alternative for iframes.  And much of the example came from: [Web Components Vs Iframes Blog](http://webagility.com/posts/web-components-vs-iframes)

I plan to contiuously play with the ideas behind WebComponents to see what is possible with my user's browsers.
